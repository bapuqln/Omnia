## Description

**Omnia** contains a huge collection of handy extensions for your everyday project. Inspired by utility and standard libraries from many other languages such as Kotlin, Ruby, Javascript, Haskell, ... **Omnia** implements the most necessary extensions. It won't add 💩 or anti patterns.

All extension names use prefix `e` (e stands for extension) to avoid potential conflicts, and to give you clue that these are not built in by default.

Supports iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS.
